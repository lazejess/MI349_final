            <h4>MSU Resident Life</h4>
            <p>At MSU, I involved myself with the Residence Hall Association, where I served as the Shaw Senate Representative, a member of the Committee of Budget, as well as a member of the Committee of Internal Affairs. I developed a passion for improving the living situation for students in the dorms and ensuring that their student tax money was being invested back into the student body. I continued my involvement with resident life by taking on roles as a Resident Assistant and a Student Success Mentor.</p>

                <h4>PGN Professional Organization</h4>
                <p>During my time in PGN, I picked up the role as Vice President of Membership where I oversaw the recruitment committee and new member education. Working so closely with underclassmen and helping them develop the crucial professional skills needed to succeed in the business world was a joy. I learned about my passion for mentoring others and each new member that I worked with taught me something.</p>

        <h3>Who I am</h3>
        <h5>Michigan State University Senior</h5>
        <p>I am a senior studying supply chain management and information technology at Michigan State University. Throughout my years at MSU, I have heavily involved myself with student resident life on campus and the professional development organization, PGN. After finishing my last semester of undergrad, I will be joining General Motors in their rotational program for Global Purchasing and Supply Chain. </p>
        <h6>Professional Interests</h6>
        <p>My professional interests include procurement, value chain engineering, and negotiations. I plan to improve my knowledge and performance in those fields throughout my time in the TRACK rotational program at General Motors. A professional goal of mine is to work internationally with suppliers, specifically in China or South Korea. I plan to accomplish this goal while working a rotational in electronics procurement at GM.</p>
        <h6>Personal Interests</h6>
        <p>Personal interests of mine include sailing and music. In my spare time, I am usually found out on the lake in the summer or by my piano in the colder months. I have spent more time focusing on my personal interest recently as I believe they keep me from burning out by commiting too much time to professional and educational goals. A personal goal I have for this upcoming summer is to learn how to golf. Who knew so many business professionals play so often? Perhaps that goal could be considered a professional one too if it helps me network.</p>
