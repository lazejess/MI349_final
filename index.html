        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>I am a senior studying supply chain management and information technology at Michigan State University. Throughout my years at MSU, I have heavily involved myself with student resident life on campus and the professional development organization, PGN. After finishing my last semester of undergrad, I will be joining General Motors in their rotational program for Global Purchasing and Supply Chain. </p>

            <h4>MSU Resident Life</h4>
            <img src="rha.png" alt="Residence Hall Association Logo" class = "work_img">
            <p>At MSU, I involved myself with the Residence Hall Association, where I served as the Shaw Senate Representative, a member of the Committee of Budget, as well as a member of the Committee of Internal Affairs. I developed a passion for improving the living situation for students in the dorms and ensuring that their student tax money was being invested back into the student body. I continued my involvement with resident life by taking on roles as a Resident Assistant and a Student Success Mentor</p>
            <h4>PGN Professional Development Organization</h4>
            <img src="pgn.png" alt="PGN Logo" class = "work_img">
            <p>During my time in PGN, I picked up the role as the Vice President of Membership where I oversaw the recruitment committee and new member education. Working so closely with underclassmen and helping them develop the crucial professional skills needed to succeed in the business world was a joy. I learned about my passion for mentoring others and each new member that I worked with taught me something.</p>
