        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <h3>Senior at Michigan State University</h3>
        <p>I am a senior studying supply chain management and information technology at Michigan State University. Throughout my years at MSU, I have heavily involved myself with student resident life on campus and the professional development organization, PGN. With resident life, I involved myself with the Resident Hall Association, where I served as the Shaw Senate Representative, a member of the Committee of Budget, as well as a member of the Committee of Internal Affairs. I developed a passion for improving the living situation for students in the dorms and ensuring that their student tax money was being invested back into the student body. During my time in PGN, I picked up the role as the Vice President of Membership where I oversaw the recruitment committee and new member education. Working so closely with underclassmen and helping them develop the crucial professional skills needed to succeed in the business world was a joy. I learned about my passion for mentoring others and each new member that I worked with taught me something. After finishing my last semester of undergrad, I will be joining General Motors in their rotational program for Global Purchasing and Supply Chain.</p>
