            <h4>MSU Resident Life</h4>
            <p>At MSU, I involved myself with the Residence Hall Association, where I served as the Shaw Senate Representative, a member of the Committee of Budget, as well as a member of the Committee of Internal Affairs. I developed a passion for improving the living situation for students in the dorms and ensuring that their student tax money was being invested back into the student body. I continued my involvement with resident life by taking on roles as a Resident Assistant and a Student Success Mentor</p>

Working so closely with underclassmen and helping them develop the crucial professional skills needed to succeed in the business world was a joy. I learned about my passion for mentoring others and each new member that I worked with taught me something.</p>
